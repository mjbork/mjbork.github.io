  <h1>about me</h1>
  <p>
    Born and raised in Baku, I completed my secondary education with my final year as an exchange student in Wisconsin, USA. I graduated with a BFA in Sculpture and Painting from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2007, focusing on audio-video production and new media under the guidance of professor-turned-dean Kevin Hamilton. His mentorship shaped my approach to media as a tool for communities to represent themselves authentically.
  </p>
  <p>
    Between 2006 and 2008, I worked as a videographer and editor at UIUC, collaborating on community and academic projects, including the Community Informatics Corps at the iSchool. Shortly after, I had a brief stint in Chicago as an assistant video editor before relocating to Boston from 2008 to 2012, where I edited branded content and PBS documentaries while obtaining professional certifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2013, I have been based between Argentina and the United States, adapting to new cultures and languages while working remotely. My experience includes collaborating with volunteer organizations, producing multilingual multimedia campaigns, and continuously integrating AI-driven workflows and storytelling techniques into my creative practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m passionate about combining cross-cultural insights and advanced technology to craft impactful visual narratives that resonate with diverse audiences.
  </p>

  <h2>experience highlights</h2>
  <p>
    Over the years, I have led creative direction and video production for tech, lifestyle, and Web3 brands worldwide. My work spans long-form documentaries, branded content, social videos, and AI-accelerated pipelines for content creation. I’ve also contributed to community media projects in Argentina, helping build social presence and secure sponsorships for food banks and community centers.
  </p>

  <h2>volunteer work & collaborations</h2>
  <p>
    My volunteer efforts include supporting community centers and food banks in Northwest Argentina, working with organizations such as <a href="https://bancodealimentostuc.org.ar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banco de Alimentos Tucumán</a> and <a href="https://basalta.org.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banco de Alimentos Salta</a>. I have also helped integrate crypto-donation platforms in collaboration with local initiatives and Argentine crypto companies like Ripio and Satoshi Tango.
  </p>
  <p>
    These experiences have enriched my understanding of social impact through media and technology while reinforcing my commitment to using storytelling for meaningful community engagement.
